scored <- c(14, 14, 9, 14, 28, 13, 13, 24, 17, 6, 24, 0, 24, 13, 26, 14)
against <- c(19, 30, 16, 38, 31, 24, 23, 30, 41, 13, 20, 52, 13, 31, 24, 47)

#Part 1: These questions refer to the vector scored
#1 How many points did the Raiders score in game 7?
scored[7]
#2 What was the score of the first 5 games?
scored[1:5]ã€€
#3 What were the scores of the even games? Try to do this problem without typing in c(2,4,...)
scored[seq(from = 2, to = length(scored), by = 2)]
#4 What was the score of the last game? Try to do this problem without typing in the number of the last game.
scored[length(scored)]
#5 Select the scores higher than 14.
scored[scored > 14]
#6 Select the scores equal to 14.
scored[scored == 14]
#7 Select the scores equal to 13 or 14.
scored[scored == 13 | scored == 14]
#8 Select the scores between between 7 and 21 points.
scored[scored >= 7 & scored <= 21]
#9 Sort the scores in decreasing order.
sort(scored, decreasing = TRUE)
#10 What was the highest score achieved?
sort(scored, decreasing = TRUE)[1]
#11 What was the lowest score achieved?
sort(scored, decreasing = FALSE)[1]
#12 What was the average score?
mean(scored)
#13 Use the summary() function to give some summary statistics.
summary(scored)
#14 In how many games did the Raiders score over 20 points?
length(scored[scored>20])

# Part 2: These questions refer to both vectors.
#1 What was the sum of the scores in game 7?
sumScore <- scored + against
sumScore[7]
#2 What was the sum of the scores in the last 5 games?
sumScore[(length(scored)-4):length(scored)]
#3 What was the difference in scores in the odd games?
diffScore <- scored - against
diffScore[seq(from = 1, to = length(diffScore), by = 2)]
#4 Which games did the Raiders win?
label <- c(1:length(diffScore))
label[diffScore > 0]
#5 Were there any ties?
sum(diffScore == 0) > 0
